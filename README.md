# Расширение-переводчик bilibili
Browser extension to translate bilibili into English (now on manifest version 3)

# Word from the Developer2
Hello all. I decided to migrate this project to a new version of the manifest so that it can be run in modern chrome.

If you find errors in the translation (I do not guarantee their absence), you can either change the dictionary yourself or let me know.

### I am not the creator of this project!

# How to Install
1. Open chrome, open extension menu from Settings or type "chrome://extensions/" to address bar.
2. Turn on "Developer mode".
3. Press "Load unpacked" and select extracted folder (You have to select whole folder).
4. Press refresh icon (No need, just in case).
5. Turn off "Developer mode" (Optional).

# Notes
1. English will be overlayed a couple seconds after opening the page
2. When switching between tabs, if there is no page refresh, that tab will not be translated. Hit refresh, and you should see the translations
3. This translation only covers basic UI stuff, to help with navigation. 

# Future Features (maybe2)
1. Translations on pop-up windows
2. Auto-refresh translation when moving between tabs
3. Translations covering more aspects of Bilibili
4. Increase code efficiency to make translations appear faster
4. More languages
